# Menu + Button Package for ebinten

## Idea
Evety menu is a collection of buttons.
### Button
Every button is an interface, containing two interfaces
First - Collision managers, interface though which user interacts with button
For example throught mouse..
Second is Drawer - interface that draws and changes a button behavior
### Menu
Essentially menu is button fabric(not sure)
Menu is used for exmaple in cases, when you need to use arrows, to switch between buttons is the same menu
